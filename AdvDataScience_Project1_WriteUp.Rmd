## Data Source

The data will be retrieved from the github repo linked by Jeff.
As far as I can tell there aren't any "write-ups" persay, but we can analyze individuals' R code.
To that extent, we need simply search each individuals' repo for the file "run_analysis.R".

However, I have seen at least one student (Benjamin Chan) who put most of their R code into a their Markdown document, then simply 
sourced this document with their "run_analysis.R" file.

## Scientific Question

Ultimately, I think the scientific question we're asking here is how can we quantify the differences in the way 
people write code.

## Current plan of attack

It seems to me like a logical place to start in terms of explaining the variability in how individuals solved this 
problem will be in the number of function calls they made, as well as the number of different functions they used, 
what packages these functions are associated with, and the "intended use" of said functions. 
To identify these patterns we can use do some fairly straightforward regular expression parsing. 
Depending on the number of unique functions
